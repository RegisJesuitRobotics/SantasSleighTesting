Needs for hanging hatches automatically:
1. Align on white gaffer tape
2. Two sensors on front to rotate robot until square against the hatch holder
3. Select which height to place the hatch
4. Try to combine actions (move forward and raise) while getting robot into proximity
5. Place hatch (via mechanism)

1. Align on white gaffer tape
    - photoelectric sensor facing down at center point of driving wheels (so we just spin)

2. Use proximity/distance sensors to measure distance and determine rotation direction
